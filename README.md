# LÖVE Template

An opinionated template/starter project for [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) game framework projects.

Still under construction and not quite ready for serious use.

Includes:
- An [.editorconfig file](https://editorconfig.org)
- A [.luacheckrc file](https://luacheck.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html) for [Luacheck](https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck) with some basic defaults for LÖVE projects
- A trivial "game" which implements the most important `love` callbacks and already has separate "Game" and "Player" objects. Basic pausing is implemented.

## License

Consider this under the zlib license for now (the same license LÖVE itself uses).
